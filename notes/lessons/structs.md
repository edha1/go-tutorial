# ðŸ§± Structs

*See structs.md in code-snippets examples!* 

- Similar to objects in other languages, a struct is a **collection of fields.**
- If a pointer points to a struct, we can get the value of the field in a struct using: **pointer.fieldName**, without explicity dereferencing. 
- When defining a struct, you can list subsets of the fields, by doing **fieldname: value**.
