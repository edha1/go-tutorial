# ☝️ Pointers 

- A pointer holds the **memory address** of the value. 
- Like in C, *T is a pointer to a **value** that is of **type** **T**.
```go 

// a pointer which points to a memory address which holds an integer value 
var pointer *int


// *p will denote the actual value held at the pointer's address. 
```
- The **&** operator generates a pointer to its operand.
