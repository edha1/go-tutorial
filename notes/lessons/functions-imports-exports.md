# üì¶ Packages, Imports and Exports 

- Every Go program is made up of **packages**. Package names correlate to the last element of the import path. 
- We can import packages: 
```go 
import (
    "math/rand"
    // some other packages
)
```

- We could also write imports as the following: 
```go 
import "math/rand"
import // other packages here 
```
- The program starts in the **main** package. 

*See exported-names.md for example* 
- A name is **exported** if it begins with a capital letter.  
- Unexported names are **not accessible** outside the package.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functions 

*See basic-functions.md for examples*

- Functions can take arguments 
- Declaration involves the type being declared **after** the variable mame. 
- Functions can return any number of results. 
- **Naked** return statements are those without any values.
