# ↪️ Loops

## ⛏ For Loop Strucutre

- A for loop has 3 parts: the **initialisation** of a variable, 
a **condition** for which the loop is evalutated, and the 
**post statmenent**, which is executed at the end of every statement. 
- A for loop without an initalisation and post statement can be used as a while loop.
- To make an infinite loop, we can simply remove any conditions.
